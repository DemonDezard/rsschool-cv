<h3><b><p>About Myself:</p></b></h3>
<p>I have been fascinated by creating worlds since childhood. Of course it was making games. It all started with the Warcraft 3 editor, in which you could even make a first-person shooter, although Warcraft 3 itself was a top-down strategy. Of course, even in the editor it required programming, but the programming was visual</p>
<p>The next stage was the Construct 3 program, which is written in Javascript. The construction of the logic in the game was also done using visual programming, but was much more complex than the Warcraft 3 editor. I had to understand things like loop, array, dictionary, JSON, for, etc. And on PlayMarket you can already see my games created in JavaScript, which have achieved some success. The games themselves are created according to the principle of a browser in the shell of an Android program</p>
<p>Why did I choose to learn pure coding when I knew everything so well from visual programming? Creating games through third-party programs is cool, but I want to understand more deeply what exactly I'm doing, and also try myself in more serious projects than just games</p>
